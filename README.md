Galaga Clone in JavaScript / 2d Canvas

Wrote this really quickly a couple years ago just for the heck of it. It was going to be part of an easter egg on a website, but nixed that idea.

Use keyboard keys to move (4 degrees of movement!) and space to shoot. If you hit an enemy with your ship you lose health. Shoot 5000 points worth of enemies (about 2 minutes worth of playing) and get the completed screen.

The code is eh.. alright for a demo. There are a lot of bugs and stuff I would change if I were to refactor it.

The graphics are MIT licensed too. Drawn by me paint.net
